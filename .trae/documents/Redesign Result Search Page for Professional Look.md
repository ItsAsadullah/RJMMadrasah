I will redesign the **Result Search (ফলাফল অনুসন্ধান)** page to make it look modern, professional, and user-friendly.

### **Proposed Changes:**

1.  **Enhanced Search Interface (Search Section):**
    *   **Modern Card Layout:** Replace the existing simple box with a polished card design featuring soft shadows, rounded corners, and a clean white background.
    *   **Header Branding:** Add the institution's logo and name prominently at the top of the search card with a professional typography style.
    *   **Improved Input Fields:** Style the dropdowns and input fields with better spacing, focus states, and icons to make them intuitive.
    *   **Responsive Grid:** Organize the inputs (Exam, Year, Class, Student ID) in a smart grid layout that adapts perfectly to mobile and desktop screens.
    *   **Gradient Background:** Add a subtle, professional gradient or pattern to the page background to give it a premium feel.

2.  **Refined Result Presentation (Result Section):**
    *   **Transcript Container:** Keep the print-optimized transcript layout (as it is designed for A4 paper) but present it on-screen in a centered, shadow-lifted container.
    *   **Floating Action Bar:** Redesign the "Print" and "Search Again" buttons into a modern, sticky or floating toolbar for easy access.
    *   **Visual Feedback:** Add smooth transitions and loading states for a seamless user experience.

3.  **Technical Details:**
    *   Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
    *   Utilize **Lucide React** icons for visual cues.
    *   Ensure **Mobile Responsiveness**.
    *   Keep the **Print Styling** intact so the physical output remains perfect.

This redesign will elevate the user experience, making it feel like a high-quality educational portal.
